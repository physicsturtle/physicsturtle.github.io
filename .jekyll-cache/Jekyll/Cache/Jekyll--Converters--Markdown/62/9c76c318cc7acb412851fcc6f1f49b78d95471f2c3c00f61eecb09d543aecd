I"¢<p>Here we will define cylindrical coordinates. If you have learned about polar coordinates in single variable calculus, then this discussion will be a direct extension of polar coordinates to three dimensions. In cylindrical coordinates, the three variables are</p>
<ol>
<li> $r$, the distance from the $z$ axis </li>
<li> $\varphi$, the angle measured in the $xy$ plane from the postiive $x$ axis. </li>
<li> $z$ the height above the $xy$ plane. </li>
</ol>

<p>The cylindrical coordinate system is shown in the figure below.</p>

<p>(insert figre here)</p>

<p>We will need to learn how to transform between the cylindrical coordinate system and the cartesian coordinate system. We will provide a few basic formulas here, but postpone the transformation of things like basis vectors to later. If we have a point $x,y,z$ in 3D space, then its corresponding cylindrical coordinates are</p>

\[\begin{cases}
r = \sqrt{x^2+y^2} \\
\varphi = \arctan\frac{y}{x} \\
z = z \end{cases}\]

<p>A quick remark about the formula for $\varphi$. The above formula is not technically correct for all values of $\varphi$. If $x = y = -1$, then $y/x =1$, which is the same as when $x = y = 1$. Thus we get the same value for $\varphi = \pi/4$. However, we want to assign the value $\varphi = 5\pi/4$ when $x = y = -1$! Additionally, we restrict the output of $\arctan$ to always lie between $-\pi/2$ and $\pi/2$. To ammend this formula to give correct values for negative $x$, and to allow $\varphi$ to range between $-\pi$ and $\pi$, we can instead write</p>

\[\varphi = \begin{cases}
\arctan\frac{y}{x} &amp; x &gt; 0\\
\arctan\frac{y}{x} + \pi &amp; x &lt; 0, y\geq 0\\
\arctan\frac{y}{x} - \pi &amp; x &lt; 0, y\leq 0\\
\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; x = 0, y &gt; 0 \\
-\frac{\pi}{2} &amp; x  = 0, y &lt; 0 \\
\end{cases}\]

<p>To transform back to cartesian from cylindrical, the formulas are</p>

\[\begin{cases}
x = r\cos\varphi\\
y = r\sin\varphi \\
z = z \end{cases}\]
