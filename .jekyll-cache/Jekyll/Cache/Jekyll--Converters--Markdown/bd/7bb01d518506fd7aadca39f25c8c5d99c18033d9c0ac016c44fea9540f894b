I"à<p>The tight-binding model considers a system for which the electrons are tightly bound to their atoms. The implications of this is that, even when the electron wave functions on nearby sites overlap, the overlap is not that large, so the resulting localized wave functions closely resemble their atomic constituents. We can derive the energy eigenvalues of such a situation in the following way. We start by considering an isolated atom centred at the origin. The atom has numerous energy levels \(E_n\), which are all localized eigenfunctions (such as the wave functions of a hydrogen atom). The Schr√∂dinger equation for such a situation is</p>
