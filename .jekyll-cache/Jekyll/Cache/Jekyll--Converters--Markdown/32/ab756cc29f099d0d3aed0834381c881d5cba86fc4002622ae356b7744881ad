I"o<p>It is common in physics to deal with probability distributions which are Gaussian or almost Gaussian. For this reason, we need to learn how to compute expectation values of physical observables with respect to these Gaussian or almost Gaussian probability distributions. The key mathematical tool to develop here is learning how to compute Gaussian integrals.</p>
