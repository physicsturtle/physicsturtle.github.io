I"¡<p>In undergraduate quantum mechanics, we often compute the time-evolution of operators. In many-body quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, it is often easier to put the time-dependence on the operators instead. This is particularly the case when we compute expectation values over ensembles. This involves a trace over the entire Hilbert space, and putting the time-evolution on operators, rather than on each of the states in the Hilbert space, is a much more neat way to organize the calculations. Putting the time-evolution on the operators is known as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Heisenberg picture", whereas when it is on the states, we have the</code>Schr√∂dinger picture‚Äù. If we have interactions, it is also often helpful to write the time-evolution in terms of the ``interaction picture‚Äù, where we split off the solvable simple part of the Hamiltonian, and the complicated interacting part of the Hamiltonian.</p>
