I"<p>To understand the origin and consequences of pairing correlation, consider a pair of electrons (2\(e^-\)) interacting. The other electrons (\(N-2\) of them) are noninteracting, and form the Fermi sea. We assume that we have a translationally invariant system and spin-independent interactions. The goal of this section is to derive a rewriting of the Schr√∂dinger equation in momentum space, which will allow us to show that, to form a bound state, an attractive interaction is required in at least one angular momentum channel.</p>
