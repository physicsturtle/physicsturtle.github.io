<li> <div class="exercise">  Consider an insulating wire with length \(\ell_1 + \ell_2\), which contains a linear charge density of \(\lambda\) (units charge/length). Assume that the origin is at a distance \(\ell_1\) from the bottom of the wire, as shown in the figure.
<ol type="a">
<li> Find the potential \(V\) at the point \((0,0,r)\) a distance \(r\) from the line of charge. 
</li>
<li> Compare your answer to part (a) with the expected potential if \(r \gg (\ell_1 + \ell_2)\).
</li>
<li> Check your answer to part (a) in the limit \(r \ll (\ell_1 + \ell_2)\) by comparing the electric field \(\mathbf{E}\) derived from \(V\) with the field derived using the infinite length case (shown in example).
