I"ç<p>In classical mechanics, a simple harmonic oscillator is a system consisting of a mass \(m\) which experiences a <i>harmonic potential</i>, namely a quadratic potential. Typically, the potential energy is produced by a spring, whose restoring force is \(F(x) = -kx\), where \(k\) is the spring constant. The The corresponding potential energy is found by integrating the following equation:</p>
