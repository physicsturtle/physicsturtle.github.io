I"Ä<p>Consider a particle confined to a box. The situation is depicted pictorially below. This scenario is highly idealized, and is not easily realizable in experiment. However,  it plays an important pedagogical role because it will allow us to develop some physical intuition without getting too bogged down with mathematical details. In the 1-dimensional SchrÃ¶dinger equation, we use the following potential, in Eq.\eqref{eq:infinite_square_well}</p>
