I"í<p>In the section on Coulombâ€™s law, we found one method of computing the electric field. Although it is very general, it is often quite cumbersome to evaluate the integrals. There are, thankfully, other methods to compute the electric field of a charge distribution. One of these methods is known as Gaussâ€™s law, which is one of the four Maxwell equations that we will meet throughout the notes. We will come to Gaussâ€™s law later, but we first need the idea of <i>electric flux</i>.</p>
