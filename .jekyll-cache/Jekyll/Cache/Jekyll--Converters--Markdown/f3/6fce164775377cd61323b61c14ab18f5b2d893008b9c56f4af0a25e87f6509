I"Í<p>Partial wave theory is concerned with decomposing the scattering wave functions into different angular momentum modes. For a spherically symmetric potential, the different angular momentum modes will all scatter independently, so we can look at each one separately. For a spherically symmetric potential, we start by rewriting the Schr√∂dinger equation as a 1 dimensional problem with an effective potential \(V_\text{eff}\). The Schr√∂dinger equation for this situation is given by</p>
