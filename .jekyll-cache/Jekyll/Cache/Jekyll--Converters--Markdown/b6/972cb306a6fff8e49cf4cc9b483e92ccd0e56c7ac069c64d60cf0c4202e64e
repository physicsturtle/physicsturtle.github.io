I"×<p>We wish to generalize the discussion to theories of bosons on a lattice. In this situation, we obviously do not just have one type of particle which may occupy many different states. Instead, we have many different possible occupiable states (e.g. different sites on a lattice), and many different possible occupation numbers of the bosons on each site. This requires us to generalize the coherent states of the previous section. These new coherent states satisfy</p>
