I"›<p>In this tutorial, we will develop a couple of technical results that will be useful in the development of partial wave theory. The partial wave expansion applies when we are in the intermediate region where we can approximate the potential as \(V \approx 0\), and we then want to connect the solution to the scattering region where the potential is nonzero. This is done by matching boundary conditions.</p>
