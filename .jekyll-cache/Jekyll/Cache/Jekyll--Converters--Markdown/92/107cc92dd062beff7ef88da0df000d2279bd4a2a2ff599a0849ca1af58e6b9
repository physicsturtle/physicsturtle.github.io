I"A<p>We consider a Hamiltonian parameterized by some set of parameters organized into a vector \(<b>X</b>\). This set of parameters could be, for example, the 3 components of a magnetic field, the point in \(\k\) space for some condensed matter system, orâ€¦.. The set of parameters \(<b>X</b>\) are taken from some set, and the topology of this set is what will often concern us in topological physics. The Hamiltonian we consider is a function on these parameters, but not a function of time. However, we let the Hamiltonian depend on time via the parameters \(<b>X</b>\):</p>
