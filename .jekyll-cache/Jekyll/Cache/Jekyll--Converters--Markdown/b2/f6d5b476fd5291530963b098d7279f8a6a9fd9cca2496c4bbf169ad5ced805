I"w<p>In this section, we will formulate the partition function for a field theory of fermions. We will do this in the grand canonical ensemble. We will employ the generalized expressions for the trace and identity formulated in Section ??, because the Hilbert space now contains many accessible single-particle states. The expression for the partition function is given by</p>
