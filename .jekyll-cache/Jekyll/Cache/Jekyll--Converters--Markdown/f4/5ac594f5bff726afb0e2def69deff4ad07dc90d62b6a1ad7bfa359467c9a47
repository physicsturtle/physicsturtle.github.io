I"W<p>The integrating factor is a very useful and general technique for solving many kinds of linear, nonlinear, ordinary, and partial differential equations. In this section, we will apply the technique to the simplest case, which is that of a first order linear inhomogeneous equation. We aim to find a solution to the equation of the form</p>
