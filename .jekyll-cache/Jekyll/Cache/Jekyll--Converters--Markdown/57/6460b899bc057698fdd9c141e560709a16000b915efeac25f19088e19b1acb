I"^<p>In this section, we will describe Poisson’s formula for solving Laplace’s equation on a circular domain. The purpose of the formula is to formulate a very general expression for the solution, in terms of the boundary conditions. The PDE is the Laplace equation on a disk of radius \(a\), with a regularity condition at the origin \(r=0\).</p>
