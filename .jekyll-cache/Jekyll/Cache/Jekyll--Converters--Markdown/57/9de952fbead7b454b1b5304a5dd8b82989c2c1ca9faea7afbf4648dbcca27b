I"«	<p>In the SchrÃ¶dinger picture, the states are time dependent and the operators are time independent. States obey the SchrÃ¶dinger equation</p>

\[\begin{equation} \label{eq:schr_equation}
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\ket{\Psi_S(t)} = \hat{H}(t)\ket{\Psi_S(t)},
\end{equation}\]

<p>where the Hamiltonian \(\hat{H}(t)\) is potentially time dependent. Whether or not the Hamiltonian is time dependent, we can write the evolution of a state at time \(t\) to a time \(tâ€™\) in terms of the <i>time evolution operator</i> \(\hat{U}(tâ€™,t)\).</p>

\[\begin{equation} \label{eq:time_evolution}
\ket{\Psi_S(t')} = \hat{U}(t',t)\ket{\Psi_S(t)}
\end{equation}\]

<p>If we plug \eqref{eq:time_evolution} into \eqref{eq:schr_equation}, then we find that</p>

\[\begin{equation}
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\ket{\Psi_S(t')} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\hat{U}(t',t) \ket{\Psi_S(t)}
\end{equation}\]

<p>Then, we use the SchrÃ¶dinger equation to rewrite the left hand side as</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{H}(t')\ket{\Psi_S(t')} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\hat{U}(t',t) \ket{\Psi_S(t)}
\end{equation}\]

<p>Now, we write the \(\ket{\Psi_S(tâ€™)} = \hat{U}(tâ€™,t)\ket{\Psi(t)}\), and get</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{H}(t')  \hat{U}(t',t)\ket{\Psi_S(t)} = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\hat{U}(t',t) \ket{\Psi_S(t)}
\end{equation}\]

<p>Since this equation is to be true for any state \(\ket{\Psi}\), we conclude that</p>

\[\begin{equation}
 i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\hat{U}(t',t) = \hat{H}(t') \hat{U}(t',t)
\end{equation}\]

<p>which is the differential equation for the time evolution operator. In general, to solve this equation is extremely difficult, and it must be expressed as a time-ordered exponential. We will come to this detail later when we develop perturbation theory. For now however, we can discuss some simple cases where we can exactly solve for \(\hat{U}\).</p>

<p>If \(\hat{H}\) is a time independent Hamiltonian, then we can solve explicitly for this time evolution operator \(\hat{U}\). For a time independent Hamiltonian, we get</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{U}(t',t) = e^{-i\hat{H}(t'-t)/\hbar}.
\end{equation}\]

<p>This allows us to define the SchrÃ¶dinger states in terms of states at \(t = 0\). We can write a state at a general time \(t\) by</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_S(t)} = \hat{U}(t,0)\ket{\psi_S(0)} = e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar} \ket{\psi_S(0)} 
\end{equation}\]

<p>We may also write \(\hat{U}(t,0) = \hat{U}(t)\).</p>
