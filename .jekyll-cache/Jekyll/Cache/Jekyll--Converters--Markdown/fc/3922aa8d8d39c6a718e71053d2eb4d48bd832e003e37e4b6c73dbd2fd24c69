I"<p>All particles have certain intrinsic properties. The most commonly known property of a particle (or collection of particles) is the mass. As we have studied in classical mechanics, a system of masses interacts through the gravitational force, as Newton studied back in 1687 in his <i>Principia Mathematica</i>. Another property of all matter is the <i>electric charge</i>. Just as the mass of an object is intimately familiar (we all have to lift objects every day!), so is electric charge. When shuffling across a fluffy carpet and then touching a metal door handle, one experiences an electric shock, as <i>electric charge</i> is transferred between your hand and the door handle. In contrast to mass, which is always positive, electric charge can either be positive or negative. For example, when you put a battery into a remote control, the battery has a positive and negative side. Positive charge comes out of the \(+\) side, and goes in to the negative side. The battery must be plugged in the right way, otherwise it does not work!</p>
