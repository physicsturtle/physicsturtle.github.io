I"ª<p>In this section, we will solve some simple physical problems by using Gaussâ€™s law.</p>

<p>There are 3 prototypical examples of systems to which we can apply Gaussâ€™s law. We will go through each of them in detail.</p>

<p>Letâ€™s now provide another derivation of Gaussâ€™s law in differential form.</p>

\[\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\frac{\hat{R}}{R^2}\rho(\r')\d V'\]

<p>with \(<b>R</b> = \r - \râ€™\). Thus</p>

\[\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\nabla\cdot\frac{\hat{R}}{R^2}\rho(\r')\d V'\]

<p>but</p>

\[\nabla\cdot\frac{\hat{R}}{R^2} = 4\pi\delta(\r-\r')\]

<p>which tells us that</p>

\[\nabla\cdot\mathbf{E} = \frac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0}\int\nabla\cdot 4\pi\delta(\r-\r') \rho(\r')\d V' = \frac{1}{\epsilon_0}\rho(\r)\]

<p>Gaussâ€™s law becomes useful when the magnitude of the electric field on a particular Gaussian surface is constant, and is always parallel or perpendicular to the normal vector of the surface.</p>

<b>Example:</b>
Consider a uniformly charged sphere of radius \(a\). Find the electric field inside and outside the sphere. 

By symmetry, \(\mathbf{E}\) is radially outward. Thus \(\mathbf{E} = E(r)\hat{r}\). We consider a Gaussian surface of radius \(r\). We get 

\(\)\oint\mathbf{E}\cdot\d<b>A</b> = E4\pi r^2\(\)

and inside the sphere we have that 

\(\)Q_\text{enc} = \frac{\rho r}{3\epsilon_0}\(\)

whereas the enclosed charge if you're outside of the sphere is just \(Q\). Thus

<b>Example:</b>
Consider an infinite plane uniformly charged. Find the electric field everywhere. 

We pick a Gaussian pillbox, and get

\(\)\mathbf{E} = \frac{\sigma}{2\epsilon_0}\hat{n}.\(\)
