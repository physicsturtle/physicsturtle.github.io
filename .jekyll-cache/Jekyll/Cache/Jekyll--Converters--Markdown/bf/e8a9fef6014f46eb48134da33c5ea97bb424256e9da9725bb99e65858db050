I"o<p>The tight-binding model considers a system for which the electrons are tightly bound to their atoms. The implications of this is that, even when the electron wave functions on nearby sites overlap, the overlap is not that large, so the resulting localized wave functions closely resemble their atomic constituents. We can derive the energy eigenvalues of such a situation in the following way. We start by considering an isolated atom centred at the origin. The atom has numerous energy levels \(E_n\), which may be localized eigenfunctions, or scattering states. The scattering states are <i>not</i> considered. The localized eigenfunctions can be thought of as the wave functions of a hydrogen atom, although these wave functions will of course be modified in the presence of other nuclei, as well as interactions with electrons from other shells. Let us ignore the interactions between electrons on the particular atom, as well as the interactions between electrons on different atoms. This means that we can consider a single-particle Schrödinger equation. The single-particle Schrödinger equation for an atom is given by</p>
