I"Æ<p>Consider an adiabatically transported parameter. The Hamiltonian is \(\Hhat = \Hhat(\boldsymbol{\lambda}(t))\), where \(\boldsymbol{\lambda}\) are parameters of the Hamiltonian. We assume that the internal frequency is much greater than teh external frequency. Goal: calculate how an eigenstate of the Hamiltonian at <i>fixed</i> poarameter varies with time. If \(\Hhat\) is independnet of time, then a particle starting in the \(n\)th eigenstate</p>
