I"ß<p>Trigonometric integrals are integrals that have trigonometric functions in them. It is useful to learn to evaluate these integrals because they come up in the study of differential equations (and therefore in physics), and we will also reduce certain integrals to trigonometric integrals by using trigonometric substitution later. Please note that trigonometric integrals (the subject of this section) are not to be confused with the method of trigonometric substitution.</p>
