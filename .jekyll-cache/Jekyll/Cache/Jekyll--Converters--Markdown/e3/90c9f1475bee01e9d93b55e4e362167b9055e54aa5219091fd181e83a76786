I"å<p>In the previous section, we showed that, for a bound state to occur, the potential must be attractive in at least one angular momentum mode. This was done for two particles in a vacuum. In this section, we will show that any infinitesimally small interaction can lead to a bound state if there are other particles around. To do this, we note that now that \(\k\) below \(k_F\) should already be filled up, and therefore \(\epsilon_{\k}\) should be measured from \(\epsilon_F\).</p>
