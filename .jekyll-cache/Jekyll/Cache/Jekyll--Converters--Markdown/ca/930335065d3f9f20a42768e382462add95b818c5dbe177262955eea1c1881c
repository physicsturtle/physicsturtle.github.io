<li> Calculate the classical action for a particle of mass \(m\) moving in a harmonic potential well \(V(x) = \frac{1}{2}m\omega^2 x^2\), where the particle starts at \(x_a\) and ends at \(x_b\).
</li>
<li> Expand a general trajectory between \(x_a\) and \(x_b\) as 
\(\)x(t) = x_\text{cl}(t) + x_q(t)\(\)
