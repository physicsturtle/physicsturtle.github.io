I"A<p>So far, we have not considered the effect of spin-orbit coupling in a material. We will do this now. In undergraduate quantum mechanics, spin-orbit coupling, for example between an electron in hydrogon and the nucleus, is derived without explicit reference to special relativity. Instead, most authors choose to present a physical cartoon based on viewing the motion of the proton around the electron instead of the other way around. This cartoon is nice, but spin-orbit coupling arises very naturally from the Dirac equation for the electron. We will discuss this now.</p>
