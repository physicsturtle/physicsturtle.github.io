I"|<p>In this section, we will use the path integral formalism to study the possibility of spin density waves in the Fermi Hubbard model. We will find for example a spin-density wave with wave vector \((\pi,\pi)\), which corresponds to the special case of antiferromagnetism. The Hubbard-Stratonovich field which we will use in this section is actually a vector field instead of the simpler fields that have been discussed so far. In the next section, where we discuss charge density wave order, there is a single Hubbard-Stratonovich field, but an additional complication arises which is not present in the spin density wave section.</p>
