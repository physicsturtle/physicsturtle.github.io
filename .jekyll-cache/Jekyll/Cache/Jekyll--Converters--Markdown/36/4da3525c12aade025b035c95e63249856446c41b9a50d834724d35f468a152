I"w<p>In this section, we consider a more realistic Hubbard-Stratonovich decoupling, where we look for spin density wave order. Instead of considering only the \(z\) component of an internal magnetic field, we consider all three \(x,y,z\) components. This preserves the original spin-rotation invariance in the original Hubbard model, which we recall is given by the action</p>
