I"><p>The Dirac delta function \(\delta(x)\) is a function which is extremely sharply peaked at \(x = 0\). Strictly speaking, it is not a function at all, but rather a distribution. We will not delve into the theory of distributions in these notes, but rather treat it as a function that has some unusual properties.</p>
