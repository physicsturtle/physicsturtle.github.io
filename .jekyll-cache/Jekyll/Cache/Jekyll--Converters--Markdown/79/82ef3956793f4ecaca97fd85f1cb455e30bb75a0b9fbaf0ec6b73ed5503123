I"¸<p>In undergraduate quantum mechanics, one typically derives the SchrÃ¶dinger equation in the presence of spin-orbit coupling for the hydrogen atom. This is done by thinking about the effective magnetic field seen by the electron, when looking at the orbit of the proton around the electron in the electronâ€™s frame. However, it may not be clear how to generalize this argument to an electric potential generated by a lattice of ions.</p>
