I"y<p>So far, we have studied the Ising model, Heisenberg model, and other classical models. These models are described in terms of very concrete spin degrees of freedom. In order to construct a field theory for the Ising model, we will introduce an extremely important tool known as the <i>Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation</i>. Normally, the Gaussian integral is given by</p>
