I"é<p>In undergraduate quantum mechanics, we often compute the time-evolution of operators. In many-body quantum mechanics and quantum field theory, it is often easier to put the time-dependence on the operators instead. This is particularly the case when we compute expectation values over ensembles. This involves a trace over the entire Hilbert space, and putting the time-evolution on operators, rather than on each of the states in the Hilbert space, is a much more neat way to organize the calculations. Putting the time-evolution on the operators is known as the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Heisenberg picture", whereas when it is on the states, we have the</code>Schr√∂dinger picture‚Äù. If we have interactions, it is also often helpful to write the time-evolution in terms of the ``interaction picture‚Äù, where we split off the solvable simple part of the Hamiltonian, and the complicated interacting part of the Hamiltonian.</p>

<p>For clarity, in this section, we will explicitly denote, with subscripts, when operators are in each picture, be it Schr√∂dinger, Heisenberg, or interaction.</p>

<h3 id="schr√∂dinger-picture">Schr√∂dinger Picture</h3>

<p>In the Schr√∂dinger picture, the states are time dependent and the operators are time independent. States obey the Schr√∂dinger equation</p>

\[\begin{equation} \label{eq:schr_equation}
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\ket{\Psi_S(t)} = \hat{H}(t)\ket{\Psi_S(t)},
\end{equation}\]

<p>where the Hamiltonian \(\hat{H}(t)\) is potentially time dependent. Whether or not the Hamiltonian is time dependent, we can write the evolution of a state at time \(t\) to a time \(t‚Äô\) in terms of the <i>time evolution operator</i> \(\hat{U}(t‚Äô,t)\).</p>

\[\begin{equation} \label{eq:time_evolution}
\ket{\Psi_S(t')} = \hat{U}(t',t)\ket{\Psi_S(t)}
\end{equation}\]

<p>If we plug \eqref{eq:time_evolution} into \eqref{eq:schr_equation}, then we find that</p>

\[\begin{equation}
i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\ket{\Psi_S(t')} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\hat{U}(t',t) \ket{\Psi_S(t)}
\end{equation}\]

<p>Then, we use the Schr√∂dinger equation to rewrite the left hand side as</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{H}(t')\ket{\Psi_S(t')} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\hat{U}(t',t) \ket{\Psi_S(t)}
\end{equation}\]

<p>Now, we write the \(\ket{\Psi_S(t‚Äô)} = \hat{U}(t‚Äô,t)\ket{\Psi(t)}\), and get</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{H}(t')  \hat{U}(t',t)\ket{\Psi_S(t)} = i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\hat{U}(t',t) \ket{\Psi_S(t)}
\end{equation}\]

<p>Since this equation is to be true for any state \(\ket{\Psi}\), we conclude that</p>

\[\begin{equation}
 i\hbar\frac{\partial}{\partial t'}\hat{U}(t',t) = \hat{H}(t') \hat{U}(t',t)
\end{equation}\]

<p>which is the differential equation for the time evolution operator. In general, to solve this equation is extremely difficult, and it must be expressed as a time-ordered exponential. We will come to this detail later when we develop perturbation theory. For now however, we can discuss some simple cases where we can exactly solve for \(\hat{U}\).</p>

<p>If \(\hat{H}\) is a time independent Hamiltonian, then we can solve explicitly for this time evolution operator \(\hat{U}\). For a time independent Hamiltonian, we get</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{U}(t',t) = e^{-i\hat{H}(t'-t)/\hbar}.
\end{equation}\]

<p>This allows us to define the Schr√∂dinger states in terms of states at \(t = 0\). We can write a state at a general time \(t\) by</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\ket{\psi_S(t)} = \hat{U}(t,0)\ket{\psi_S(0)} = e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar} \ket{\psi_S(0)} 
\end{equation}\]

<p>We may also write \(\hat{U}(t,0) = \hat{U}(t)\).</p>

<h3 id="heisenberg-picture">Heisenberg Picture</h3>

<p>In the Heisenberg picture, the states are time independent, and the operators are time dependent. To find how these states and operators are related to the Schr√∂dinger picture, we require that expectation values remain the same in every picture. That is, if \(\hat{A}\) is any operator, then</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\langle\hat{A}\rangle = \bra{\psi_H}\hat{A}_H(t)\ket{\psi_H} = \bra{\psi_S(t)} \hat{A}_S \ket{\psi_S(t)}
\end{equation}\]

<p>We define the Heisenberg states \(\ket{\psi_H} = \ket{\psi_S(0)}\). Thus, we find that</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\bra{\psi_S(t)} \hat{A}_S \ket{\psi_S(t)} = \bra{\psi_H}\hat{U}^\dagger (t,0)\hat{A}_S\hat{U}(t,0) \ket{\psi_H} 
\end{equation}\]

<p>so we identify the quantity \(\hat{U}^\dagger (t,0)\hat{A}_S\hat{U}(t,0)\) as \(\hat{A}_H(t)\). We can write this as</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{A}_H(t) := e^{i\hat{H}t/\hbar} \hat{A}_S e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar} 
\end{equation}\]

<p>The Heisenberg equation of motion of a (time independent) operator is given by</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\frac{\d A}{\d t} = i[H,A]
\end{equation}\]

<h3 id="interaction-picture">Interaction Picture</h3>

<p>In the interaction picture, also known as the Dirac picture (although I do not think ``Dirac picture‚Äù is common terminology), the states and operators are both time dependent, but in a different way than seen in the previous two pictures. We again require that expectation values be the same. However, this time, the interaction picture time evolution is given by</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{A}_I(t) := e^{i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar}\hat{A}_S e^{-i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar}.
\end{equation}\]

<p>Using this, we can find how the interaction picture states are defined. To do this, we again return to the expectation values and get</p>

\[\begin{align}
\bra{\psi_S(t)}\hat{A}_S\ket{\psi_S(t)} ={}&amp;\bra{\psi_I(t)}\hat{A}_I(t) \ket{\psi_I(t)} \\
\bra{\psi_S(0)}e^{i\hat{H}t/\hbar} \hat{A}_S e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}\ket{\psi_S(0)}  ={}&amp; \bra{\psi_I(t)} e^{i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar}\hat{A}_S e^{-i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar} \ket{\psi_I(t)} \\
\end{align}\]

<p>from which we conclude that</p>

\[\begin{equation}
e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar}\ket{\psi_S(0)} = e^{-i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar}\ket{\psi_I(t)},\qquad \ket{\psi_I(t)} = e^{i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar}e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar} \ket{\psi_S(0)}.
\end{equation}\]

<p>so calculating the time evolved interaction picture operators is much easier than calculating the time evolved interaction picture state. This also gives us the relationship between the Heisenberg and interaction picture operators:</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{A}_I(t) = e^{i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar}e^{-i\hat{H}t/\hbar} \hat{A}_H(t) e^{i\hat{H}t/\hbar} e^{-i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar}
\end{equation}\]

<p>We can find the time evolution operator in the interaction picture by writing</p>

\[\begin{align}
\ket{\psi_I(t')} ={}&amp; e^{i\hat{H}_0t'/\hbar}e^{-i\hat{H}t'/\hbar} \ket{\psi_S(0)}\\
\ket{\psi_S(0)} ={}&amp; e^{i\hat{H}t/\hbar}e^{-i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar}\ket{\psi_I(t)}
\end{align}\]

<p>which allows us to plug the second equation into the first, and find</p>

\[\begin{align}
\ket{\psi_I(t')} = e^{i\hat{H}_0t'/\hbar} e^{-i\hat{H}(t'-t)/\hbar} e^{-i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar} \ket{\psi_I(t)}
\end{align}\]

<p>and therefore we find that</p>

\[\begin{equation}
\hat{U}_I(t',t) = e^{i\hat{H}_0t'/\hbar} e^{-i\hat{H}(t'-t)/\hbar} e^{-i\hat{H}_0t/\hbar}
\end{equation}\]
