I"6<p>In this section, we will perform another kind of Hubbard-Stratonovich calculation which allows us to investigate the propensity of a model of interacting electrons, interacting via an attractive interaction (as opposed to a repulsive interaction, as usual) to form a superconducting state. How electrons can attract each other is, at this point, abstracted away. The various microscopic mechanisms which can lead to attraction could be due to phonons, electron-electron overscreening, antiferromagnetism, or more. These will not be discussed in this section.</p>
