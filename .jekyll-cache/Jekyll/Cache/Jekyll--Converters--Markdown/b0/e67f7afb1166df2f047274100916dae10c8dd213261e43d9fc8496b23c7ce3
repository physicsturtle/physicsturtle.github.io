<p>As with the case of lines, there are two ways to define planes.</p>

<h3 id="equation-form">Equation Form</h3>

<p>Suppose we have a point $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ which is in our plane, and the plane has normal vector \((a,b,c)\). Let \(\textbf{r} = (x,y,z) \) be a vector to some point in 3D space. Letâ€™s find a condition on this vector \(\textbf{r}\) such that its terminal point lies within the plane. If \(\textbf{r}\) points to the plane, then the vector \(\textbf{r} - (x_0,y_0,z_0)\) will be a vector that is parallel, or, tangent, to the plane. If it is tangent to the plane, its dot product with the planeâ€™s normal vector will be zero. Thus the condition we are left with is</p>

\[(a,b,c)\cdot(\textbf{r} - (x_0,y_0,z_0)) = 0\]

<p>This can be expanded out to be</p>

\[a(x-x_0) + b(y-y_0) + c(z-z_0) = 0\]

<p>or, moving the constant terms to the other side,</p>

\[ax + by + cz = ax_0 + by_0 + cz_0\]

<p>where we can relabel the right hand side as \(d\):</p>

\[ax + by + cz = d\]

<h3 id="parametric-form">Parametric Form</h3>
<p>In the parametric form, we express the plane in terms of a vector function of two parameters. Let $(x_0,y_0,z_0)$ be a point in the plane, and $\textbf{u}$ and $\textbf{v}$ be two non-collinear vectors that span the plane. Then we can write the plane as</p>

\[\textbf{r}(s,t) = \begin{bmatrix} x_0 \\ y_0 \\ z_0 \end{bmatrix} + s\textbf{u} + t\textbf{v}\]
