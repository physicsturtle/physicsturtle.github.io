I"Ç<p>In the previous section, we discussed the notion of a matrix inverse. As we know, a matrix \(A\) times its inverse equals the identity \(\sum_j A_{ij}(A^{-1})_{jk} = \delta_{ik}\). However, matrices have a finite number of elements in them, and their indices \(i,j\) in \(A_{ij}\) are integers. If we have an operator \(\int \mathcal{O}(x,xâ€™)u(xâ€™)\d xâ€™ = f(x)\), and we want to find out what \(u\) is, the inverse of \(\mathcal{O}\) is defined by the same condition, namely \(\int \mathcal{O}(x,xâ€™)\mathcal{O}(xâ€™,xâ€) \d xâ€™ = \delta(x-xâ€)\). This continuous analogue requires us to study the properties of the Dirac delta function, which is the continuous analogue of the Kronecker delta.</p>
