I"¤<p>In this section, we will discuss Wickâ€™s theorem for evaluating correlation functions of many points. It can be applied to Gaussian probability distribution functions. When we say Gaussian probability functions, this could mean some discrete, continuous, or even functional distribution functions. (check the terminology here). Suppose we have a probability density function of a real variable \(\x \in \RR^d\).</p>
